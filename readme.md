# Google Photos metadata matcher

Faster alternative to https://github.com/anderbggo/GooglePhotosMatcher

# Some things to note

- This is my first rust project so it's not perfect

- It will not match 100% of the files sometimes (less than 1% of the time) due to naming discrepancies between the title inside the json file and the actual file name

- Does not match geo data

- Does not delete the json files

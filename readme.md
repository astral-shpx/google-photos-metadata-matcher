# Google Photos metadata matcher

Faster alternative to https://github.com/anderbggo/GooglePhotosMatcher

# Some things to note

- It will not match 100% of the files due to naming discrepancies between the title inside the json file and the actual file name

- This is my first rust project so it's not perfect

- It will take some time before the progress bar appears

- You have to build it yourself currently

- There are two checkboxes which are not implemented and should not be checked

- Does not match geo data

Faster alternative to https://github.com/anderbggo/GooglePhotosMatcher

# Some things to note

- This is my first rust project so it's not perfect

- It will take some time before the progress bar appears

- You have to build it yourself currently

- There are two buttons which are not implemented and should not be checked
